	    <li><p> The columns of <m>A</m> are

	    <li><p>
	      Evaluate <m>T\left(\twovec{100}{900}\right) =

	    <li><p>
	      We solve <m>T(\xvec) = A\xvec = \twovec{550}{450}</m> to

	    </p></li>

	    <li><p> We denote the distribution of trucks Monday

	    <ol label="i.">

	      <li><p> Tuesday evening, we have

	    <li><p> Because <m>S(\xvec) = T(T(\xvec)) = AA\xvec =

	    <li><p> The matrix is <m>A^7 \approx \left[\begin{array}{rr}

	    <li><p> If we compute <m>A^k\xvec_0</m> for some very
