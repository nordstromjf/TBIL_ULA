             <li>   <p>
                I can determine if a matrix is invertible, and if so, compute its inverse.

            </li>
            <li>   <p>
                I can invert an appropriate matrix to solve a system of linear equations.

            </li>
             <li>   <p>
                I can explain why a set of Euclidean vectors is or is not a basis of <m>\IR^n</m>.

                <li>   <p>
                I can compute a basis for the subspace spanned by a given set of Euclidean vectors, and determine the dimension of the subspace.

                I can find a basis for the solution set of a homogeneous system of equations.

            <li>   <p>
                I can compute a basis for the null space and a basis for the column space of a linear map, and verify that the rank-nullity theorem holds for a given linear map.
