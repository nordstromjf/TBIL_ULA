<p> A pair of vectors <m>\vvec_1</m> and
    <m>\vvec_2</m> is called <em>positively</em> oriented if the
    angle, measured in the counterclockwise direction, from
    <m>\vvec_1</m> to <m>\vvec_2</m> is less than <m>180^\circ</m>;
    we say the pair is <em>negatively</em> oriented if it is more than
    <m>180^\circ</m>.</p>

  <p> Suppose a <m>2\times2</m> matrix <m>A</m> has columns
  <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>.  If the pair of vectors is
  positively oriented, then the <em>determinant</em> of
  <m>A</m>, denoted <m>\det A</m>, is the area of the
  parallelogram formed by <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>.
  If the pair is negatively oriented, then <m>\det A</m> is
  minus the area of the parallelogram. </p>
      </statement>

     <p> For the next several activities, We will use geometry to find the determinant of some

  <p><ol label="a.">
    <li><p> The matrix <m>U_1</m> is invertible because we see
    there is a pivot position in every row and column.  The

    </p></li>

    <li><p> The determinant of an upper triangular matrix equals
    the product of its diagonal entries.  Consequently, if the
    determinant of an upper triangular matrix is not zero, then
    each of its diagonal entries must be nonzero.  In this case,

    that the matrix is invertible.  </p></li>

    <li><p> Row replacement operations do not change the

    <li><p> In the same way, <m>\det A = \det A_2</m>. </p></li>

    <li><p> Interchanges change the sign of the determinant so

    </p></li>

    <li><p> The determinant <m>\det U = -4</m> since it is the
    product of the diagonal entries of <m>U</m>.  This means
    that <m>\det A = 4</m>.  We see that <m>A</m> is invertible
    because <m>U</m>, which has a pivot position in every row
    and every column, is invertible.
    </p></li>

    <li><p> Beginning with a row replacement operation, we
    arrive at

    1 \amp - 1 \amp 3 \\
    0 \amp 2 \amp -2 \\

    we see that <m>\det A = 2\det U = 0</m>.  In this case,
    <m>A</m> is not invertible because <m>U</m>, which has a row
