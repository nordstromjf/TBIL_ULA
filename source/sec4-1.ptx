  <p> Given a square <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>, we say
  that a nonzero vector <m>\vvec</m> is an <em>eigenvector</em>
  of <m>A</m> if there is a scalar <m>\lambda</m> such that
  <me>
    A\vvec = \lambda \vvec
  </me>.
  The scalar <m>\lambda</m> is called the <em>eigenvalue</em>
  associated to the eigenvector <m>\vvec</m>.

    <p>This definition has an important geometric interpretation

    <p>Now we will look at an application of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.</p>

    <activity xml:id="activity-eigen-intro">
      <introduction>

      <p> Suppose that we work for a car rental company that has two
      locations, <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>.  When a customer rents a car
      at one location, they have the option to return it to either
      location at the end of the day.  After doing some market
      research, we determine:
      <ul>
  <li><p> 80% of the cars rented at location <m>P</m> are
  returned to <m>P</m> and 20% are returned to
  <m>Q</m>. </p></li> 

  <li><p> 40% of the cars rented at location <m>Q</m> are
  returned to <m>Q</m> and 60% are returned to
  <m>P</m>. </p></li>
      </ul></p></introduction>

      
  <task><p> Suppose that there are 1000 cars at location <m>P</m>
  and no cars at location <m>Q</m> on Monday morning.  How many
  cars are there are locations <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> at the end
  of the day on Monday?  </p></task>

  <task><p> How many are at locations <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> at end
  of the day on Tuesday? </p></task></activity>

  <activity><introduction>
    <p>Continue with the car company example.</p>
     <p> If we let <m>P_k</m> and <m>Q_k</m> be the number of
  cars at locations <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, respectively, at the
  end of day <m>k</m>, we then have
  <me>
    \begin{aligned}
    P_{k+1}\amp {}={} 0.8P_k + 0.6Q_k \\
    Q_{k+1}\amp {}={} 0.2P_k + 0.4Q_k\text{.} \\
    \end{aligned}
  </me>
  We can write the vector <m>\xvec_k = \twovec{P_k}{Q_k}</m> to
  reflect the number of cars at the two locations at the end of
  day <m>k</m>, which says that
  <me>
    \begin{aligned}
    \xvec_{k+1} \amp {}={}
    \left[\begin{array}{rr}
    0.8 \amp 0.6 \\
    0.2 \amp 0.4 \\
    \end{array}\right]
    \xvec_k \\
    \\
    \text{or}\qquad
    \xvec_{k+1} \amp {}={}
    A\xvec_k
    \end{aligned}
  </me>
  where <m>A=\left[\begin{array}{rr}0.8 \amp 0.6 \\ 0.2 \amp 0.4
  \end{array}\right]</m>.
      </p>
      <p> Suppose that
      <me>
  \vvec_1 = \twovec{3}{1},
  \qquad
  \vvec_2 = \twovec{-1}{1}
      </me>.</p></introduction>
      
      <task><p>Compute <m>A\vvec_1</m> and <m>A\vvec_2</m> to demonstrate that
      <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m> are eigenvectors of <m>A</m>.</p></task>

      <task><p>What are the associated eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1</m> and

    <activity><introduction>
    <p>Continue with the car company example and <me>
  \vvec_1 = \twovec{3}{1},
  \qquad
  \vvec_2 = \twovec{-1}{1}
      </me> from the previous activity.</p></introduction>
      
      <task><p> We said that 1000 cars are initially at location
      <m>P</m> and none at location <m>Q</m>.  This means that the
      initial vector describing the number of cars is <m>\xvec_0 =
      \twovec{1000}{0}</m>.  Write <m>\xvec_0</m> as a linear
      combination of <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>. </p></task>

      <task><p> Remember that <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>
      are eigenvectors of <m>A</m>.  Use the linearity of matrix
      multiplicaiton to write the vector <m>\xvec_1 =
      A\xvec_0</m>, describing the number of cars at the two locations
      at the end of the first day, as a linear combination of
      <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>.  </p></task>

      <task><p> Write the vector <m>\xvec_2 = A\xvec_1</m> as a linear
      combination of <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>.  Then write
      the next few vectors as linear combinations of <m>\vvec_1</m>
      and <m>\vvec_2</m>:
      <ol label="i">
  <li><p> <m>\xvec_3 = A\xvec_2</m>. </p></li>
  <li><p> <m>\xvec_4 = A\xvec_3</m>. </p></li>
  <li><p> <m>\xvec_5 = A\xvec_4</m>. </p></li>
  <li><p> <m>\xvec_6 = A\xvec_5</m>. </p></li>
      </ol>
      </p></task>

      <task><p> What will happen to the number of cars at the two
      locations after a very long time?  Be able to explain how writing
      <m>\xvec_0</m> as a linear combination of eigenvectors helps you
      determine the long-term behavior. </p></task>
