  <p> Given a square <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>, we say
  that a nonzero vector <m>\vvec</m> is an <em>eigenvector</em>
  of <m>A</m> if there is a scalar <m>\lambda</m> such that
  <me>
    A\vvec = \lambda \vvec
  </me>.
  The scalar <m>\lambda</m> is called the <em>eigenvalue</em>
  associated to the eigenvector <m>\vvec</m>.

      <statement>

      <p> Suppose that we work for a car rental company that has two
      locations, <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>.  When a customer rents a car
      at one location, they have the option to return it to either
      location at the end of the day.  After doing some market

  <li><p> 80<percent /> of the cars rented at location <m>P</m> are
  returned to <m>P</m> and 20<percent /> are returned to
  <m>Q</m>. </p></li>

  <m>P</m>. </p></li>
