    <li><p> Solving for the weights of the linear combination of

    <li><p> More generally, we have <m>\xvec_k=2(1.3)^k\vvec_1 +

    becomes insignificantly small so that <m>\xvec_k\approx

    <li><p> Now we have <m>\xvec_0 = 3\vvec_1 + \vvec_2</m>.  In

    <m>R_k\approx6(1.3)^k</m> and <m>S_k\approx3(1.3)^k</m>.
    This gives the same ratio:  <m>R_k/S_k\approx

    <li><p> No matter what the starting populations, we will
    have <m>\xvec_0 = c_1\vvec_1+c_2\vvec_2</m> and

    <m>S_k\approx c_2(1.3)^k</m> and ratio <m>R_k/S_k\approx
    2</m>. </p></li>

    <li><p> We see that <m>\xvec_{k+1}\approx 1.3\xvec_k</m> so

    <li><p> With this matrix <m>A</m>, we have

    This shows that the population of one species does not
    depend on the other.  This dynamical system is a saddle
    because we have the eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1=0.7</m> and
    <m>\lambda_2=1.6</m>.  Eventually, species <m>R</m> will
    become extinct while species <m>S</m> grows by a factor of
    1.6.

      \end{alignedat}
    </me>
    The population of species <m>S</m> is not influenced by
    species <m>R</m>.  However, we see that the population of
    species <m>R</m> grows in the presence of species <m>S</m>.
    In other words, species <m>S</m> helps species <m>R</m> to
    grow so we say that <m>S</m> is beneficial for <m>R</m>.
  </p>

  <p> Because the eigenvalues are <m>\lambda_1=0.7</m> and
  <m>\lambda_2=1.6</m>, this dynamical system is again a
  saddle.  The associated eigenvectors are
  <m>\vvec_1=\twovec10</m> and <m>\vvec_2=\twovec13</m>.  After
  a long time, the population vector <m>\xvec_k\approx
  c_1(1.6)^k\vvec_2</m> so both populations grow by a factor of
  1.6 and with a ratio <m>R_k/S_k=1/3.</m>

    </me>
    Species <m>S</m> helps species <m>R</m> to grow, while
    species <m>R</m> inhibits the growth of species <m>S</m>.
    One explanation for this is that species <m>R</m> preys on
    species <m>S</m> as a food source.
  </p>

  <p> We have eigenvectors <m>\vvec_1=\twovec11</m> with
  associated eigenvalue <m>\lambda_1=1.2</m> and
  <m>\vvec_2=\twovec{5}{4}</m> with <m>\lambda_2=1.1</m>.  This
  dynamical system is a repellor so both species will grow
  arbitrarily large.
    </p></li>

    <li><p> This example is similar to the previous one, but the
    coefficients are slightly different.  We see that the growth
    rate of both species is smaller.  For instance, in the
    previous problem, we had <m>R_{k+1}=0.7R_k+\ldots</m> while
    we now have <m>R_{k+1}=0.5R_k+\ldots</m>.  This says that
    the reproduction rate of species <m>R</m> has decreased
    from <m>0.7</m> to <m>0.5</m>.  In the same way, that of
    species <m>S</m> has decreased from <m>1.6</m> to
    <m>1.1</m>.  Also, <m>R_{k+1}=\ldots + 0.2S_k</m> so the
    presence of species <m>S</m> is less beneficial to species
    <m>R</m>.  </p>

    <p> We now have the eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1=0.9</m> and
    <m>\lambda_2=0.7</m>, which means that this dynamical system is
    an attractor and that both species will become
