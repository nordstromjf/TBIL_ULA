    <title>What can we expect</title>
    
   <p>In these first explorations, we aim to develop some intuition for the
        type of behavior we can expect to see when looking at solutions of
        systems of linear equations. The solution to a linear equation in three unknowns <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>,
        and <m>z</m> is a plane.  Use <m>3\times5</m> cards as models for planes to study the solutions
            to systems of linear equations in three variables.</p>
