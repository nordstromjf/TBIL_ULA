Otherwise, the set of vectors is called linearly independent .    We would like to develop a means of detecting when a set of vectors is linearly dependent. These questions will point the way.    Consider whether the set of Euclidean vectors is linearly dependent or linearly independent.   Reinterpret this question as an appropriate question about solutions to a vector equation.  Use the solution to this question to answer the original question.    Suppose we have five vectors in that form the columns of a matrix having reduced row echelon form .  Is it possible to write one of the vectors as a linear combination of the others? If so, show explicitly how one vector appears as a linear combination of some of the other vectors.

If is an invertible matrix, what is its reduced row echelon form?       In this activity, we let and construct its inverse . For the time being, let's denote the inverse by so that .  We know that . If we write , then we have . This means that we need to solve the equations . Using the Sage cell below, solve these equations for the columns of .   What is the matrix ? Check that and .   To find the columns of , we solved two equations, and . We could do this by augmenting two separate times, forming matrices and finding their reduced row echelon forms. But instead of solving these two equations separately, we could also solve them together by forming the augmented matrix and finding the row reduced echelon form. In other words, we augment by the matrix to form . Form this augmented matrix and find its reduced row echelon form to find .   Assuming is invertible, we have shown that .    If you have defined a matrix in Sage, you can find it's inverse as A.inverse() . Use Sage to find the inverse of the matrix .     What happens when we try to find the inverse of the matrix ?    Suppose that matrices and are both invertible. What do you find when you simplify the product ? Explain why this shows the product is invertible and .     We have seen how to use Gaussian elimination to find the inverse of a matrix. Now we want to look at how to use matrix multiplication to perform Gaussian Elimination.    Tweaking the identity matrix slightly allows us to write row operations in terms of matrix multiplication.   Create a matrix that doubles the third row of :   Create a matrix that swaps the second and third rows of :   Create a matrix that adds times the third row of to the first row:      Consider the two row operations and applied as follows to show :   Express these row operations as matrix multiplication by expressing as the product of two matrices and : Check your work using technology.    We have now seen how to do Gaussian elimination with matrix multiplication. If we are careful to describe our row operation with lower triangular matrices, then we can connect matrix multiplication to finding the inverse. We will see this through the next couple of activities.    Let . When performing Gaussian elimination on , we first apply a row replacement operation in which we multiply the first row by and add to the second row. After this step, we have a new matrix . .
