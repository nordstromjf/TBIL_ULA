<p>Suppose that we work for a car rental company that has two locations, <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span>  When a customer rents a car at one location, they have the option to return it to either location at the end of the day.  After doing some market research, we determine:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>80% of the cars rented at location <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> are returned to <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and 20% are returned to <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>40% of the cars rented at location <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> are returned to <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> and 60% are returned to <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Suppose that there are 1000 cars at location <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and no cars at location <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> on Monday morning.  How many cars are there are locations <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> at the end of the day on Monday?</p></li>
<li><p>How many are at locations <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> at end of the day on Tuesday?</p></li>
