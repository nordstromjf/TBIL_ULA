<p>Suppose we run a company that has two warehouses, which we will call <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> and a fleet of 1000 delivery trucks. Every day, a delivery truck goes out from one of the warehouses and returns every evening to one of the warehouses.  Every evening,</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>70% of the trucks that leave <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> return to <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span>  The other 30% return to <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>50% of the trucks that leave <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> return to <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> and 50% return to <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will use the vector <span class="process-math">\(\xvec=\twovec{P}{Q}\)</span> to represent the number of trucks at location <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> in the morning.  We consider the matrix transformation <span class="process-math">\(T(\xvec) = \twovec{P'}{Q'}\)</span> that describes the number of trucks at location <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> in the evening. <div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-18"><script type="text/x-sage">

<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>Suppose that all 1000 trucks begin the day at location <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and none at <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span>  How many trucks are at each location at the end of the day? Therefore, what is the vector <span class="process-math">\(T\left(\ctwovec{1000}{0}\right)\text{?}\)</span></p>
<p>Using this result, what is <span class="process-math">\(T\left(\twovec{1}{0}\right)\text{?}\)</span></p>

<li><p>In the same way, suppose that all 1000 trucks begin the day at location <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> and none at <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span>  How many trucks are at each location at the end of the day? What is the result <span class="process-math">\(T\left(\ctwovec{0}{1000}\right)\text{?}\)</span></p></li>

<li><p>Suppose that there are 100 trucks at <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and 900 at <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> at the beginning of the day.  How many are there at the two locations at the end of the day?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that there are 550 trucks at <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and 450 at <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> at the end of the day.  How many trucks were there at the two locations at the beginning of the day?</p></li>
